    <h3 class="year">Early Life</h3>
    <p class="description">Scott was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on May 21, 1981. He had studied in Asia for one year with his father who is a science writer. Once he came back to America, he found that he was behind in grades due to the fact that he skipped ahead while studying abroad. Despite his shortcoming, Scott was able to get into Cornell University during freshman year of high school because he was enrolled in a gifted program run by Clarkson University. He recieved his BSc in computer science and then his PhD from the University of California. Having taught himself calculus at 11 years old, Scott was very intelligent in mathematics and wanted to pursue theoretical computing.  </p>

    <h3 class="year">Career</h3>
    <p class="description">Scott Aaronson joined MIT in 2007 after his postdoctorates at the Institute for Advanced Study and the University of Waterloo. He then proceeded to switch from MIT to the University of Texas for a career as a professor computer science. He also founded and directed the UT Austin's New Quantum Information Center. </p>

    <h3 class="year">Awards</h3>
    <p class="description">
      -Scott Aaronson is one of the two winners who was rewarded with the Alan T. Waterman Award in 2012.
      -He won the Best Student Paper Awards at the Computational Complexity Conference for his paper "Limitations of Quantum Advice and One-Way Communication" in 2004 and "Quantum Certificate Complexity" in 2003. 
      -He wrote the "Lower Bounds for Local Search by Quantum Arguments" which recieved the Danny Lewin Best Student Paper Award.
      -He was nominated as an ACM Fellow because of his contributions to quantum computering and computational complexity in 2019.
      -He recieved the 2020 ACM Prize in computing for his "groundbreaking contributions to quantum computing"</p>

    <h3 class="year">Popular Work</h3>
    <p class="description">Scott wrote a blog called "Shtetl Optimized" which is about the lives of people living in Jewish villages before the holocaust. He connected that story to his past as a young kid who was often viewed as "weird" for his reading abilities. He also founded the Complexity Zoo Wiki that serves the purpose of containing all classes of computational complexity. He wrote an essay named "Who can Name the Bigger Number?", which takes a look at the limits of computability using Busy Beaver Numbers. Along with his ability to write, he was also a professor of "Quantum Computing since Democritus", which was then published as a book by the Cambridge University Press. </p>

    <h3 class="year">Quote</h3>
    <p class="description">"“By any objective standard, the theory of computational complexity ranks as one of the greatest intellectual achievements of humankind -- along with fire, the wheel, and computability theory.”
